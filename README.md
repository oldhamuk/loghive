Syslog Server Solution using ELK

After years of using commercial products for syslog solutions I decided I wanted to build something simple and free.

I believe the solution is scalable for small through to large environments.

You can running everything on a single server for a small setup or you can scale out across multiple servers to
provide the resilience and separation your environment may require.

The solution comprises of:

1. Elasticsearch
2. Logstash
3. Kibana
